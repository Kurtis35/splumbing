Diagnosis

Relevant error lines: line 57–60 show the build ran "npm run build" which runs "vite build", and line 60 is the immediate error: "sh: 1: vite: not found". The failing exit is summarized at line 66.
Error type and cause: The build script calls the vite CLI but the vite binary is not present in the build environment (node_modules/.bin). This usually means vite is not installed (missing from package.json or lockfile not committed), or it is only a devDependency that was not installed during the build.
Solution

Verify vite is declared and package files are committed

Check client/package.json for vite in dependencies or devDependencies: https://github.com/Kurtis35/splumbing/blob/main/client/package.json
Ensure package.json and your lockfile (package-lock.json / yarn.lock / pnpm-lock.yaml) are committed to the repository.
If vite is missing, add it and commit

From the client folder run locally:
cd client
npm install --save-dev vite@latest
# or, if you want it as a runtime dependency:
# npm install --save vite@latest
Commit package.json and package-lock.json and push.
If vite is already in devDependencies but still not found
Ensure Netlify installs devDependencies (remove any NPM_FLAGS environment variable that adds --production), or move vite to dependencies:
# to move to runtime dependencies if you prefer
npm install --save vite@latest
Make sure the lockfile is committed so Netlify installs exactly the same deps.
Re-deploy
After committing the change, trigger a new Netlify build. The vite binary will be installed into node_modules/.bin and "npm run build" should succeed.
Optional alternatives

If you prefer not to add vite as a dependency, you can temporarily change the build command in netlify.toml to:
[build]
  command = "npx vite build"
But the recommended approach is to add vite to package.json and commit lockfile so builds are deterministic.
